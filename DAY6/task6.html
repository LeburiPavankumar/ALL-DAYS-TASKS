        <summary>SUCCESS</summary>
        <P>Success means different things to different people. For some, it means climbing to the top of the corporate ladder, or creating a brand or product that changes the world. For others, it’s getting paid to do what they love, or having the freedom to work on their own terms. But no matter what success looks like for you, one thing is certain—having the right mindset is the key to getting you there.

            That said, we all have those days where our goals feel out of reach or downright impossible. The good news is, many of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs, creatives and leaders have shared their words of wisdom to remind you of what’s possible and get your head back in the game.

        <summary>PARTICIPATION</summary>
        <p>Being an introvert I have always wondered “Is participation very important ?”

            Participation can be of many ways whether to join a group or partake in any events or fun activity.
            
            It is not wrong being an introvert but sometimes participation is very necessary. As we live in a society being social plays a vital role.
            Participation in itself has many benefits like it can help you boost up your confidence, challenge the inner self that helps you know more about you, realize your forgotten or present dreams, showcasing your talents and most of all being able to live completely to the fullest.

Life has become a race where everyone wants to or is desperate to win
