       <body><p><b> A business is an economic activity that involves the production, sale, exchange, or purchase of goods and services to satisfy customer needs and earn profits. Businesses can be for-profit or non-profit organizations. 
            Here are some types of businesses:<br>
            <u>1.Sole Proprietorship:</u> As the name suggests, a sole proprietorship is owned and operated by a single person. There is no legal separation between the business and the owner, which means the tax and legal liabilities of the business are the responsibility of the owner.
            <br>
            <u>2.Partnership:</u>
            A partnership is a business structure where two or more people share the workload, profits, and skills. Partners are personally liable for the business's debts, which means their personal assets could be used to cover business obligations.<br> 
        <u>3.Corporation.</u><br>
            A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners and managers. Owners have minimal liability for losses but may not be actively involved in business management.<br> 
            <u>4.Limited liability company(LLC):</u><br>
            An LLC is a business structure that offers limited liability protection and pass-through taxation. LLCs are less expensive to set up and have fewer regulatory and registration burdens than other business structures. 
            A business description summarizes what a company does, its purpose, and what makes it unique. It's a critical component of a business plan. </b></p>
            <p>
                <h2><b><u>KEY</u> <u>POINTS</u></b></h2>

                1.A business is defined as an organization or enterprising entity engaged in commercial, industrial, or professional activities.<br>

                4.Some businesses run as small operations in a single industry while others are large operations that spread across many industries around the world.<br>
                5.Apple and Walmart are two examples of well-known, successful businesses.<br>
                6.Activities:<br> Businesses are involved in many activities, including production, distribution, marketing, and sales.<br>
